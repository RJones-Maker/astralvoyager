        <br> <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>The Sun is a 4.6 billion-year-old star at the center of our solar system.
            An enormous ball of plasma, over 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million Celsius) in its core. 
            Everything in our solar system orbits around it, and The Earth is 93 million miles (150 kilometers) from the Sun.

        <h2>Formation</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>The Sun was formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the solar nebula, a giant, spinning cloud of dust and gas. 
                The nebula collapsed on its gravity, pulling most of the material into the center,  flattening into a disk, and becoming the Sun. 
                The remaining dust and gas formed into our solar system's planets and other bodies.
            </p>

         <h2>Solar Cycle</h2>
         <div class="info">
            <p>The solar cycle is the cycle that the Sun's magnetic field goes through approximately every 11 years. 
                Throughout the nearly 11 year period, the Sun's activity is measured in terms of changes in the number of Sunspots on the surface.
                The magnetic field of the Sun flips during each cycle, th eflip occuring when the solar cycle is near it's maximum. 
                The beginning of the solar cycle is called the solar minimum
            </p>
            <p>Sunspots are cooler regions of the Sun, over 1,000 kelvin cooler than the surrounding area. 
                These spots appear as roughly circular dark spots on the Sun's “surface.” 
                </p>
